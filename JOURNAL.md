## 10/16/2025 - Started my project  

I started my project! It looked really hard, but upon further inspection, the guide was really easy!
HELL I did not finish it yet lmao. It still has a lot left to look after! Here's an image!!
It's pretty meh, So far its a 1:1 copy, but hopefully it's not horrible.

I made sooooo many erc errors as i just went through it without reading it, i prtty much had to redo it like 10 times, hence why it took soo long. uhh but at the end, i finally finished the schematic, although i prolly will come back to it to add 4 sw_pushes and uhh yea. just pray to god i dont mess up.
